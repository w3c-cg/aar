## Purpose

As organizations continue to shift left the need to optimize upstream processes is paramount. Procurement represents one of the first opportunities to meaningfully impact the accessibility of a given initiative. Despite many advancements in this area, procurement professionals struggle to manage the myriad of complex requirements often resulting in the depriortization of accessiiblity requirements.
