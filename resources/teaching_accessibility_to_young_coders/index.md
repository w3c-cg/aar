# Teaching Accessibility to Young Coders

This resource is being created to find ways to incorporate accessibility principles into early education, as early as the introduction of computer science (or earlier).

The current intent it to:
* Identify or validate the accessibility topics that will resonate, both at the very beginning of computer science education and as kids learn more about HTML, CSS, and digital design
* Brainstorm on the most appropriate and impactful ways to teach that information, which could depend on age and the computer science topics that are being taught
* Create resources to help educator teach accessibility, in the form of learning materials, example websites, and resources for the teachers themselves to learn more
