## Purpose

Procurement plays a vital role in ensuring the development of accessible products and services. Accessibility should be embedded from the earliest stages, including ideation and vendor selection. If accessibility is not reflected in requests for proposals (RFPs) and contracts, the resulting products and services are unlikely to be accessible. Collaboration between procurement teams, contracting teams, and accessibility experts is crucial to creating inclusive outcomes.

Despite advancements in digital accessibility, many procurement professionals deprioritize accessibility requirements due to a lack of awareness, resources, and subject-matter expertise. Accessibility is often reduced to a checkbox exercise, highlighting the need for targeted guidance and tools for procurement teams.
