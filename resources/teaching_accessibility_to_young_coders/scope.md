## Purpose

To build a resource that looks at how to incorporate teaching accessibility principles to students as they first learn about coding and digital design. 

This resource will help educators by:
* outlining age appropriate accessibility principles that can be integrated into computer science or digital design courses;
* providing learning materials to support teaching these accessibility principles;
* providing guidance on how the educator themselves can learn more about accessibility to support their efforts to teach it. 


## Scope

The initial scope will focus on students in middle school, generally grades 6, 7, & 8 (ages 11, 12, and 13). 

The resource will be broken down into these sections:
* A list of accessibility principles that will resonate with these students
    * clear and understandable explanation of the principle
    * Examples of the priciple, either through real-world websites/applications, or through custom built websites
    * Examples of people with disabilities with negative and positive experiences with the accessibility principle
* A cache of learning materials for each accessibility principle
    * different learning materials for different ages
    * different learning materials for different stages of learning CS
* Guidance for educators to learn more about accessibility
    * General guidance for all educators
    * Guidance on topics to learn depending on grade/subjects taught
    * Curated lists of links to appropriate external resources

### Future scope

As this resource develops, we will explore how to incorporate accessibility principles into grades K-5, potentially outside of the context of computer science classes. One intent of this targeting this age group and non-computer science classes is to ensure that accessibility is considered regardless of the educational and professional direction the student takes. 

We will focus on incoporating accessibility priciples into computer science and digital design classes, but equally important is to understand accessibility when it comes to digital document creation and digital content creation, as many students will use productivity software throughout their education and into professional lives. 

## Audience

### Primary

Computer science educators in grades K-12.

### Secondary

* Non-computer science educators in grades K-12
* Students in grade K-12

### User Stories/Use Cases

> **As a** grade 8 computer science teacher with some accessibility experience
>
> **I want** a resource that can provide me with age appropriate digital accessibility learning materials
>
> **So that** I can incorporate them into my lessons about HTML

> **As a** grade 6 computer science teacher with no accessibility experience
>
> **I want** a resource that can give me direction on how to learn about digital accessibility 
>
> **So that** I can convey age appropriate accessibility priciples to my students

> **As a** a grade 9 computer science student
>
> **I want** a resource that explains accessibility principles in a clear and understandable way
>
> **So that** I can learn them well enough to include in my research project

### Contributors

#### Experience needs

We need contributors with a variety of experience:
* Educators in K-12 grades (to provide knowledge in creating age appropriate learning materials)
* Accessibility professionals (to help break down accessibility principles to their core intent)
* Writers (to ensure accessibility principles are accurately explained in plain language)
