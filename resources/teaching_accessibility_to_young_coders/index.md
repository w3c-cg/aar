## Abstract
The growing emphasis on accessibility in technology is driven by current and forthcoming legislation, necessitating broader integration of accessibility principles in product development. However, accessibility training typically targets existing product teams with little or no prior knowledge of accessibility, focusing on resolving current issues and embedding these practices into development workflows. While the accessibility community strongly advocates for integrating accessibility early in the development lifecycle — commonly referred to as "Shifting Left" — less attention has been given to incorporating accessibility into foundational education.

Efforts are underway to include accessibility in higher education curricula, such as computer science programs and coding bootcamps, where it has historically been underrepresented. Resources like those provided by [Teach Access](https://teachaccess.org/) support this mission. Yet, in alignment with the principle of introducing accessibility as early as possible, there is a compelling case for teaching accessibility concepts to children as young as ten. As computer science education is now introduced earlier than ever in schools, accessibility education should evolve alongside it.

This project will explore the feasibility of teaching accessibility principles to young coders, focusing on age-appropriate concepts and practical implementation. It will consider the unique challenges posed by introductory coding platforms, which often prioritize logic and problem-solving over accessibility concerns. By examining how budding coders can learn and apply these principles early, this research aims to foster a generation of developers for whom accessibility is a foundational consideration in their craft.

## Current Status
This resource is currently being developed through the [Advancing Accessibility Resources Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/adva11yresources/). 

Contributions are welcome, particularly from these groups:
* Educators of 11 to 13 year old students primarily, but also of 5-18 year old students (to provide knowledge in creating age appropriate learning materials)
* Accessibility professionals (to help break down accessibility principles to their core intent)
* Writers (to ensure accessibility principles are accurately explained in plain language)
* Designers (to help create interesting and engaging learning materials)

To contribute, please consider joining the community group - only a [W3C account](https://www.w3.org/account/request/) is required to join (which is free).
